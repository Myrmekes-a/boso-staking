# Getting Started

While the deployments of this program are not live, you can deploy your own by using these steps. This will first clone the repo then run `make keys` will generate a new keypair for your program and update authority. NOTE: You must not lose these keypairs. Substitute your own keypair in if you would like to use your own.

> Note: You must not lose the keypairs! They will be saved in ./keypairs directory. To use your own keypairs place them there and skip the `make keys` step

```bash
git clone https://github.com/solana_nft_programs/rewards-center.git
